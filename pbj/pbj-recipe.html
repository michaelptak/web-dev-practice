    <p><b><u>Tip:</u></b> <span class="gray-text">Stir peanut butter if necessary to make a smoother mixture and distribute the oil that may have settled. Ours was fine so we skipped this step.</span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step-5: Spread the Peanut Butter Onto One Slice of Bread</h2>
      <p>Get preferred amount of peanut butter onto the knife (for an accurate serving size, get about 2 tablespoons) and spread onto one slice of the bread evenly.</p>

    <h2>Step-6: Spread the Jelly Onto the Other Slice of Bread</h2>
      <p>Get preferred amount of jelly onto the knife (for an accurate serving size, get about 1 tablespoon) and spread onto one slice of the bread evenly.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step-7: Combine the Two Slices</h2>
      <p>Combine the two slices together quickly. Try to match the two slices as close as possible so the crust is evenly matched on both sides so the sandwich is more appetizing and less messy.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step-8: Cut Off the Crusts (optional)</h2>
      <p>Cut the crusts of the sandwich off using the butter knife. This step is optional for people who prefer no crusts.</p>

    <h2>Step-10: Clean Up Your Workspace</h2>
      <p>Clean up your workspace by closing the peanut butter and jelly, replacing the bread tie on the opening of the bread bag, washing your knife and disposing of your gloves.</p>

    <p>I have to say, I'm amazed. I've had these ingredients just sitting around for months and until now I've never known a use for them! I made this sandwich a few days ago, but I am wondering what I should do about the blisters on my hands due to the gloves. There were no instruction to take them off afterwards so I've been spending my days wearing them, and it's becoming a little concerning. I am also still a little confused as to why my brother didn't enjoy the sandwich, as it was not an optional instruction, after telling him this he reminded me (rudely) that he has a peanut allergy. Is it true that this would stop him from enjoying it? Anyway, I've been in the hospital with him for a while now and I'm wondering if that instruction still applies? Should I show him the article? Do you think that would make a difference? I did bring the sandwich with me in case, thanks in advance! It also doesn't specify how the jelly should be applied, so I used my better judgment and used my hand. Overall, I'd love if you went into more detail next time, maybe a few hundred steps to be sure.</p>

    <h3>Not A Clanker:</h3>
    <p>Excellent tutorial! Heres a pro and very human tip: Adding a small amount of glue in between both slices of bread can help the slices of bread adhere to one another.</p>
